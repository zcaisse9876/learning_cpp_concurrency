# learning_cpp_concurrency

Most of this repository follows along with the course:
[Modern C++ Concurrency in Depth ( C++17/20)](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-cpp-concurrency-in-depth)

The goal of this repository is to experiment with and learn about C++ 17/20 concurrency features
The repository is layed out in an... abnormal way. Most lessons and exercises I have written in class implementations with use of static methods
In order to maintain the integrity of the lessons which always use main with globally declared functions.
This allows me to have some more order, as well be able to wrap everything into one project

After completing the course it will always be used for the book I am going through:
